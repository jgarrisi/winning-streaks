Nothing much to this day. 

Meetings: 
* architecture meeting on the dashboard 2.0 project went well. we are finally diving into the data model and realizing how hard it is to normalize all the different types of widgets and data apis. 
* estimation meeting was short. not much to estimate here as most of the estimations right now are full projects and happening outside the Tuesday meeting
* project retro was good. many items brought up. many ideas for improvement.
