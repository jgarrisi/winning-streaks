Today, we got the kids up for the early church service in hopes to train them back toward a school wake up time. Church was about Nehemiah and the unsettled discomfort that drove him to respond in prayer when he heard of Jerusalem's troubles. A very clear reminder of how little I pray.

After church, nap, then decided to lace up the new Saucony Glide ISO's and go for a short run. I'm signed up fo the rookie tri in May and need to get on that training plan. Opted for the Nike Run+ app and did their "new run" guided audio coaching run. It was interesting to hear a coach in your head while running which is normally such a solitary activity. I'm going to keep trying out these guided runs.

On running and emotion: Physical endurance sports are *extremely* emotional for me. Multiple times every run, I have this obvious desire to stop, to walk, to let my head hang and be defeated by this stupid sport. Pushing past each of those points requires effort and it's like packing another clown in the car each time. Finally when I'm done (especially if I feel accomplished like the end of a race), the little emotion clowns come spilling out of the car at a rate that my now tired self doesn't maintain well. Basically, I need ten min to myself after a big run or race to process the clowns. Oddly enough this happened on my super short 1.6 mile run yesterday, but luckily I was in the park and nobody cares to look at the face of the dude on the running trail.
