Health: Allergies continue to attack! Woke up not knowing if I should take a sick day, but decided to try. Bowels unsteady. Opted to drive in so I would be able to pull over in case of emergency... didn't need it. Diarrhea continued all day.

Work: pretty smooth like most Mondays are for me. No meetings just dealing with bugs and issues.

Went to CG after work, and since I was driving, I went to Stormy's camp which is the first up the freeway. Cheryll was there of course. However, Julia, a fellow counselor from my summer at camp Buckner, was there. This was her first camp. She just moved back home after spending a decade up in the northeast. It was a fun blast from the past.
